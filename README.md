Programming in R can be hard, especially when one is unfamiliar with the language. With this workshop, we intend to teach the basis of R, while showing how it can be useful for studying marine mammals. The workshop will be divided in two parts. The morning session is targeted for beginners, where we will teach the basics of R as a programming language. By the end of the first session, participants should be familiar with the basics of base R (from vectors to for loops) and become capable of inputting and visualizing data in R, as well as running some simple analysis. The afternoon session will be dedicated to a case study involving cetaceans. Firstly, we will show how to work with simple GIS data using R, downloading and aligning environmental variables. We will then use a presence-absence dataset to model a species distribution. In this task, we will plot sighting and effort records, and run ecological models to understand how environmental variables relate to the species occurrence. Finally, we will project the model’s results into maps, to understand how the species occurs in different environmental conditions.
